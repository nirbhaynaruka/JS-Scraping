# JS-Scraping
An Automated Login API which automatically login to the SRM Academia Website and scraps the user data like Timetable, Attendance table etc and take a screenshots and save it to your local drive, save your time to login and wait for the network. Fast and smooth.

It only requires to set the SRM-Academia username and password for one time in the script and it works you individually.

The language that I used :
